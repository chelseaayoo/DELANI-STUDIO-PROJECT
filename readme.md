* Create folders for storing files. The main folder is called DELANISTUDIO and another folder called assets under DELANISTUDIO for storing images files. Create files called index.html,index.css,index.js,readme.md and licence under the main folder. 
* BDD:The 'What we do'  icons when clicked toggle between the respective description of each icon. The description is centered aligned. The header is in bold and centered also. That is achieved by using jQuery.A Hover effect for the **Portfolio ** sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture is still visible in the background. This is achieved using jQuery.  The application tells the user through a pop up that they have received their message and also thank them for contacting them.The site is responsive.
